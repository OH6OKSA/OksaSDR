# OksaSDR — status and roadmap

Updated with every build. The newest TestFlight build is at the top; what is
queued, waiting on someone, or still to verify follows.

## Next build

- Space PTT on the iPad's Magic Keyboard: a held Space keyed PTT and
  released it about 0.1 s later (UIKit sent the release while the key was
  down; the screen PTT works). iOS now takes Space from GameController too,
  only while the operate page has the keyboard (no dialog, no text entry).

- Transverter (XVTR) bands (tester request, Android): the transverters
  set up in the radio (SmartSDR or the desktop's Radio Setup > XVTR) show
  as band buttons after 6 m, as on the desktop; a tap selects the radio's
  band stack for it (X0, X1 …) and the radio tunes the RF frequency and
  does the IF. Setting transverters up in the app is for later.

To verify in build 81: SmartLink after Disconnect and a
restart; Option paddles on the iPad's Magic Keyboard (GameController); the
Android outer screen in landscape.

Parked: two-finger trackpad scrolling of the iPad's pinned panel stops
halfway (Magic Keyboard; finger scrolling works; --wheel-test finds no
blocker on the desktop).

## Planned: logging (when to build it is open)

QSO logging from the app to any logbook, through the standard ADIF routes
(analysed 2026-10-18):

1. **Quick log and callsign lookup.** Call and RST typed (or the call
   from a tapped spot); frequency, band, mode, UTC time, power and the own
   station from the radio. Name, QTH, grid and LoTW / eQSL / paper-QSL
   from QRZ.com through the engine's existing `CallsignLookupService`
   (cache, photos, distance and bearing; country, continent and CQ zone
   from cty.dat without a QRZ subscription). The QRZ password goes in the
   platform secure store (the desktop uses QtKeychain). POTA / WWFF
   fields (SIG / SIG_INFO, MY_SIG).
2. **A log on the device and destinations**, any of:
   - WSJT-X UDP "Logged ADIF" (port 2237): MacLoggerDX, Log4OM
     (ADIF_MESSAGE), HRD Logbook (QSO forwarding), GridTracker, JTAlert;
   - plain ADIF over UDP (port 2333, WSJT-X's secondary-server format):
     Log4OM, HRD; N1MM+ to confirm on a real install (ADIF import works);
   - Wavelog / Cloudlog HTTP API (`/api/qso`, a read+write key, the
     station profile from `/api/station_info`), also over mobile data;
   - an ADIF file shared to anything (mail, Files, AirDrop), e.g. LoTW
     through TQSL.
   A queue resends to HTTP destinations when the network returns; UDP
   (no acknowledgement) keeps the device log and a resend. UDP needs the
   logbook's computer on the same network or a VPN.
3. **Later:** Wavelog's `/api/radio` (frequency/mode to Wavelog's own log
   form); spots marked by LoTW users and worked-before
   (`/api/logbook_check_callsign`, upstream idea #2809); the CW decoder's
   text offering the call; QRZ.com logbook upload.

Not planned: LoTW upload from the app (needs TQSL signing with the
operator's certificate; the logbook or Wavelog does it); QSY from Wavelog
to the radio (needs a listening server on the phone, not possible in the
iOS background).

## Released

**Build 81** (2026-10-19), iPhone and iPad, and Android beta 6:
- SmartLink stays signed in after a restart and reconnects after Disconnect (the kept token was overwritten by an empty one; a refused session now signs in again from it).
- iPad keyboard paddles tell left from right Option / Control through GameController (Qt's iOS key events carry no scan code); Command keys nothing.
- Very low landscape fits (Android outer screen, smaller iPhones): metrics from the safe area, no band strip there, no safe-area binding loop.
- Keyboard paddle keys and focus in the log; dev options for the pinned panel.

**Build 80** (2026-10-18), iPhone and iPad, and Android beta 5:
- CW tab: Iambic A / B and Swap ⇄; "Paddles on a keyboard" with Ctrl (the default), Alt ⌥ (Option) or [ ], each explained; the dit and dah labels follow Swap; Command never keys a dit.
- CW refused: the radio's reason shows. On 2026-10-18 the FLEX-6600 refused every CW key-down ("another client is transmitting…") with no client on air until it was restarted; the cause is not known.
- Keying with break-in off says why nothing goes on air.

**Build 79** (2026-10-18), iPhone and iPad, and Android beta 4:
- CW paddles on the screen with the app's iambic keyer (A/B, squeeze; [ ] or Ctrl L/R on a keyboard); straight key, paddles and iambic A and B checked on air.
- CW decoder: Sens filter (default 70) and 8–45 WPM; band noise mostly gone, weak calls decode.
- Passband drag tunes on the tuning step; filter edges and notches drag on the display.
- Spot filters (mode, age); network changes in the log.

**Build 78** (2026-10-18), iPhone and iPad, and Android beta 3:
- Mic level acts on this device's microphone (own gain, −20 to +30 dB, limiter at −1 dBFS); the radio's mic level does not act on its PC input (measured: 6.2 W at level 10, 6.0 W at 90).
- Lit buttons: on = blue, off = dark (chosen from three styles after tester feedback).
- PTT tap on / off mode, with a 3-minute limit.
- Sidetone for CW memories and CW text; busiest threads in Network & performance; Android asks for the microphone on the first connect.

**Build 77** (2026-10-17), iPhone and iPad, and Android beta 2:
- Spots on the display and a DX cluster connection (spots go to the radio); tap to tune.
- TNF: hold on the display to add a notch, tap it to adjust; TNF switch in DSP.
- TX processing of this device's microphone: gate, EQ, compressor.
- Memory editing (name, frequency, mode).
- Voice keyer: Listen also for clips kept on the device.
- Mic meter reads this device's microphone; very low windows show bar meters.

**Build 76** (2026-10-17), iPhone and iPad:
- Radios on the connect page read as buttons.
- Pan slider shows C / L n / R n and snaps to centre.
- Phones open the controls only from the button beside PTT.
- The controls drawer reaches the window's bottom edge.

**Build 75** (2026-10-17), iPhone and iPad:
- OksaSDR app icon.
- Volume and pan sliders follow the finger.
- Meter peak hold resets with the meter's quantity; ALC/Mic below scale read "< min".
- MOX removed; one Mic level; device mic trim in Setup → Phone/CW.
- Callsign edited in Setup → Radio only.

**Build 74** (2026-10-17): the app is called **OksaSDR** (formerly AetherSDR
Mobile); TX soft start limited to iOS.

**Build 70** (2026-10-16): STEP fix and placement, dBm scale after band
change, info panel order, View pan settings, Band zoom, WWV/GEN, split
offsets, meter peak hold.

Earlier builds: see the git log and `TESTFLIGHT_WHATS_NEW.txt`.

## Android (beta)

Same code as iOS (`mobile/android/` holds the platform parts), built and
signed in GitHub Actions (`mobile-android.yml`); betas in
[Releases](https://github.com/OH6OKSA/OksaSDR/releases) (the newest is
marked Latest: [releases/latest](https://github.com/OH6OKSA/OksaSDR/releases/latest)).

Beta 1: receive, spectrum and waterfall, TX, background receive (foreground
service, Qt kept running), SmartLink with the sign-in kept in the Android
Keystore, Bluetooth headsets (hands-free), log sharing, LAN discovery
(multicast lock), crash reasons logged on the next start.

Beta 2: what iOS build 77 brings (spots and DX cluster, TNF, TX
processing, memory editing, voice keyer Listen, Mic meter). Published by CI
from `mobile/android/release.env`.

Beta 3: what iOS build 78 brings (Mic level as the device microphone's
gain, lit buttons, PTT tap on / off, CWX sidetone, busiest threads); the
first beta marked Latest on GitHub.

Beta 4: what iOS build 79 brings (CW paddles, decoder, edge and notch
drags, spot filters); the first published by CI as Latest.

Beta 5: what iOS build 80 brings (iambic and keyboard paddles in the CW
tab, the CW refused notice, the break-in note).

Beta 6: what iOS build 81 brings (SmartLink stays signed in and
reconnects; the outer screen in landscape fits).

Next: verify LAN discovery on the radio's network; APK size (about 150 MB).

## Later

From the comparison with upstream main and tester requests:
- Memory offsets and tones (repeaters); memory groups
- ATU tools and per-band TX settings
- Profile import and export
- QSO recording
- 3D with 768 columns
- Upstream FFT Smooth and De-comb
- Optional VOX mode (microphone always open)
- More of the desktop's TX chain (de-esser, tube, exciter, reverb) and a
  chain order
- CW profiles (new in SmartSDR 4.3)

## Waiting

- **Upstream (aethersdr/AetherSDR)**, left to wait for upstream:
  - [discussion #6409](https://github.com/aethersdr/AetherSDR/discussions/6409): upstreaming, naming, distribution (GPL and Apple);
  - [#6532](https://github.com/aethersdr/AetherSDR/issues/6532): RFC, client-side Beat Cancel;
  - [#6533](https://github.com/aethersdr/AetherSDR/issues/6533): closing the TX slice leaves no slice transmitting;
  - [#6534](https://github.com/aethersdr/AetherSDR/issues/6534): RFC, Opus under Auto over a VPN;
  - [PR #6535](https://github.com/aethersdr/AetherSDR/pull/6535) for #6051: VITA-49 loss counted net of reordering.
- **To verify:** LAN discovery on Android at the radio's own network (on the
  next visit to the cabin, where the radio is; SmartSDR 4.3.16 works: a
  tester's FLEX-6600 runs it).
- **Verified:** the TX start (no delay, no whoosh) since build 68.

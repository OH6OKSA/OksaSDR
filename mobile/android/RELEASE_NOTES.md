**OksaSDR for Android — beta 26.** A FlexRadio client for Android phones and tablets, built on the [AetherSDR](https://github.com/aethersdr/AetherSDR) engine: the same app as on the iPhone and iPad (TestFlight build 109), from the same code.

### New in beta 26
- **A swipe inside the open controls drawer** no longer tunes the radio or moves the display under it; the part of the display still in view works as before. Thanks Wayne WA2N.
- **PTT on a slice in DIGU / DIGL** says why it does not transmit (PTT is for voice; use USB / LSB, or the Digi tab for FT8 / FT4), and the radio's own reason for a refused transmit stays on screen. Thanks Charlie KB8CR.

Still new from betas 14–25: three meters while transmitting (asked by Mike VA3MW); FT8 and FT4 in the app (Controls › Digi) on every DIGU slice with WSJT-X colours, Keep CQ, Last TX and Free, PSK Reporter; Wavelog / Cloudlog; transverter setup; RADE digital voice; the log in Files › Documents › OksaSDR.

### Install or update
1. Download `OksaSDR-android-beta26.apk` below on the phone (about 150 MB).
2. Open it; allow installing from your browser or file manager when Android asks. If Chrome keeps the download waiting, open ⋮ → *Downloads* → *Keep*.
3. Beta 26 installs over earlier betas and keeps your settings. If you have one of the earlier hand-delivered test APKs, uninstall it first (different signing key).

Android 9 or newer, 64-bit ARM. On the first connect, allow notifications, the microphone and "no battery optimization" so receive keeps going in the background and PTT can transmit.

### Still to verify
- LAN discovery on the radio's own network (connect by IP works everywhere)
- More phones and tablets: please report your model and Android version

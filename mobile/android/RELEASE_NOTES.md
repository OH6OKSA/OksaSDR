**OksaSDR for Android — beta 51.** A FlexRadio client for Android phones and tablets, built on the [AetherSDR](https://github.com/aethersdr/AetherSDR) engine: the same app as on the iPhone and iPad (TestFlight), from the same code.

### New in beta 51
- **− and + at the ends of the AGC-T, RF gain, volume and squelch sliders:** drag near the value, then tap for one step or hold to keep stepping; the squelch slider shows its level. **F/R is now B/S** (bands / steps). Thanks Larry Averbeck.
- **Every panel has its name and Close at the top right** (AGC, volume, filter, meter, bands, notch, network, stations, voice keyer). In a low window the rows scroll and Close stays in sight.
- **Bigger touch targets:** the phone's rows beside and under the frequency are taller, and the lock, record and play icons wider.
- **A light tap is felt** on PTT press and release, the step buttons and − / + (Android's touch feedback setting decides).
- **Connect by host name:** ABC on the address keypad, for example a name your VPN or a dynamic DNS service gives the radio. Thanks Sebastian DG5CST.
- **The controls drawer goes full screen upright** (▲ beside Close), so FTx lists its decodes on the whole height; also a small tablet's or a split window's drawer. Thanks Michael Whaley.

### Still new from betas 49–50
- The connection no longer drops when the app goes to the background; a foldable's inner screen upright looks as on its side; the FTx time sync line; the tablet layout on a foldable's inner screen in both orientations, ⋯ in a narrow window, Keep CQ between CQ and Halt TX.

### Still new from betas 43–48
- The volume and AGC panels have their full width in a wider phone window, and the network panel fits a phone (betas 47–48).
- **Logger32:** every QSO you log can go to Logger32 on your PC (Log tab: the PC's address, port 52001). Away from home it needs your VPN; QSOs wait on the phone when the PC is not reached (thanks Juho Kontio).
- **Getting started** at the top of the manual: what each mode (voice, CW, FT8 / FT4, RADE) needs before you go on the air, and where to set it.
- Record and play back (the dot and the triangle in the slice row); F/R (now B/S) hides the band and step buttons; step buttons on the radio's STEP; the eye in password fields (thanks Larry Averbeck); a split window on a big screen fits, with a compact top.

Earlier betas (14–42): Auto after Bluetooth media back to the headset, the waterfall after a return; quick Audio output changes without silence; Audio output switching without losing the sound; FT8 / FT4 on a time server's time (thanks Kurt DL5EAG) and Keep CQ without double logging; Audio output Speaker and Bluetooth media with the phone's microphone (thanks Larry Averbeck), Band back to a band, the CW strip under the scale, no S among the transmit meters; less battery use with the spectrum on the graphics chip (thanks Mike VA3MW), "2 analog" meters, the memory in the top row; a held PTT no longer freezing tablets with an accessibility service on (thanks Kurt DL5EAG), held step buttons (thanks Larry), wider bar meters (thanks Juho); CW paddles at the phone's edges, `{HIS}` in CW memories, QRZ.com details in every logged QSO; the slice volume beside the speaker icon and a log line when the app stops answering; turning the phone keeps the display, the CW strip with [away] / [back] marks; the CQ POTA filter in FTx (thanks Ryland WW4GA) and Heard in CW on the Log tab; RADE receive on DAX channels 2 and 3 and its quick-tap end of over, the FreeDV station list by activity, New call in FTx, big logbooks, a keyboard on the phone; big ADIF imports in seconds, two-tap SmartLink Sign out; sliders, keypads, ⋯ menu and text fields the same on every device (thanks Richard EI9JE); meters Analog / Bar / Two bars with scales and peak hold, the white dashed slice line, FT8 / FT4 transmit fixed and ending when the slice goes back to voice, RADE fixes; the FreeDV tab with FreeDV Reporter (asked by Scott W5SLS), FTx and one-size control buttons, the beta number in brackets, the DX cluster status line, the display going on while the app is on screen but not in focus; a swipe in the open controls drawer no longer tunes, PTT in DIGU / DIGL says why it does not transmit, three meters while transmitting (asked by Mike VA3MW); FT8 and FT4 in the app (Controls › FTx) on every DIGU slice with WSJT-X colours, Keep CQ, Last TX and Free, PSK Reporter; Wavelog / Cloudlog; transverter setup; RADE digital voice; the log in Files › Documents › OksaSDR.

### Install or update
1. Download `OksaSDR-android-beta51.apk` below on the phone (about 150 MB).
2. Open it; allow installing from your browser or file manager when Android asks. If Chrome keeps the download waiting, open ⋮ → *Downloads* → *Keep*.
3. Beta 51 installs over earlier betas and keeps your settings. If you have one of the earlier hand-delivered test APKs, uninstall it first (different signing key).

Android 9 or newer, 64-bit ARM. On the first connect, allow notifications, the microphone and "no battery optimization" so receive keeps going in the background and PTT can transmit.

### Still to verify
- LAN discovery on the radio's own network (connect by IP works everywhere)
- More phones and tablets: please report your model and Android version

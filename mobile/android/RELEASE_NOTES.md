**OksaSDR for Android — beta 36.** A FlexRadio client for Android phones and tablets, built on the [AetherSDR](https://github.com/aethersdr/AetherSDR) engine: the same app as on the iPhone and iPad (TestFlight), from the same code.

### New in beta 36
- **A held PTT no longer freezes the app** on tablets with an accessibility service on (a pen app, the accessibility menu): the app answers Android's accessibility queries only while a screen reader such as TalkBack is on (thanks Kurt DL5EAG for the log and the screenshots).
- **Audio output** in Controls › Audio: *Auto* (a Bluetooth headset when connected), *Speaker* (stays on the phone even with Bluetooth on) or *Bluetooth media* (better sound over the music link, the phone's microphone transmits) (thanks Larry Averbeck).
- **Hold a step button to keep stepping,** about eight steps a second, also over SmartLink (thanks Larry).
- **Bar meters use the free width** beside the slice buttons: much wider in landscape, and in portrait with one slice (thanks Juho).

### Still new from beta 35
- **CW paddles at the phone's edges,** the call you are working on the CW tab (`{HIS}` in memories), QRZ.com details in every logged QSO, the CW strip filling like writing, and the tap on / off PTT's 3-minute stop working again.

Earlier betas (14–34): the slice volume beside the speaker icon and a log line when the app stops answering; turning the phone keeps the display, the CW strip with [away] / [back] marks; the CQ POTA filter in FTx (thanks Ryland WW4GA) and Heard in CW on the Log tab; RADE receive on DAX channels 2 and 3 and its quick-tap end of over, the FreeDV station list by activity, New call in FTx, big logbooks, a keyboard on the phone; big ADIF imports in seconds, two-tap SmartLink Sign out; sliders, keypads, ⋯ menu and text fields the same on every device (thanks Richard EI9JE); meters Analog / Bar / Two bars with scales and peak hold, the white dashed slice line, FT8 / FT4 transmit fixed and ending when the slice goes back to voice, RADE fixes; the FreeDV tab with FreeDV Reporter (asked by Scott W5SLS), FTx and one-size control buttons, the beta number in brackets, the DX cluster status line, the display going on while the app is on screen but not in focus; a swipe in the open controls drawer no longer tunes, PTT in DIGU / DIGL says why it does not transmit, three meters while transmitting (asked by Mike VA3MW); FT8 and FT4 in the app (Controls › FTx) on every DIGU slice with WSJT-X colours, Keep CQ, Last TX and Free, PSK Reporter; Wavelog / Cloudlog; transverter setup; RADE digital voice; the log in Files › Documents › OksaSDR.

### Install or update
1. Download `OksaSDR-android-beta36.apk` below on the phone (about 150 MB).
2. Open it; allow installing from your browser or file manager when Android asks. If Chrome keeps the download waiting, open ⋮ → *Downloads* → *Keep*.
3. Beta 36 installs over earlier betas and keeps your settings. If you have one of the earlier hand-delivered test APKs, uninstall it first (different signing key).

Android 9 or newer, 64-bit ARM. On the first connect, allow notifications, the microphone and "no battery optimization" so receive keeps going in the background and PTT can transmit.

### Still to verify
- LAN discovery on the radio's own network (connect by IP works everywhere)
- More phones and tablets: please report your model and Android version
